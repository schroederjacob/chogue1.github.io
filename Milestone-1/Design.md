### Milestone 1. Project Plan Complete

Role: Designer - Design

Technology Checklist

* Selecting the development tools we need
* Frameworks and tools to help with app creation
* How to set up the technology with the team
* Work with the team to create a basic application (helloworld)
* Deploying the app

## Blogger Bay - Technology selection

Selecting the technology is a critical step for a project, because it would create a 
clear path for the development team to start creating applications. Once the team is on 
the same page technology wise, then the project becomes much easier to troubleshoot and
to improve. Finding alternatives to building software from scratch such as using a CMS
would be critical as well, since it would save time and effort.

Web Development Framework

After careful consideration, we wanted to create BloggerBay using the Django web 
framework.

Here is why we support this decision:

  * The entire team has used python extensively for the past two to three years, posing as
  a familiar syntax to customize the app in a solid direction with little training.
  * Django with Python has a strong, dedicated group of developers that can be used as a resource
  * Django can be hosted on multiple webhosts such as Heroku, PythonAnywhere, and DigitalOcean

all developers how to setup and configure a web app using Heroku.
